#+TITLE: ACM Tech Stack
#+DESCRIPTION: Moving all of ACM's services to cloud providers is going to be a tough one.

This repository includes all the files necessary to describe and deploy the
technology stack of ACM @ UCSD. You will find files such as:

- Ansible roles and playbooks
- Terraform files
- Custom patches and images for certain services

* Introduction

ACM @ UCSD's tech stack is complex enough to warrant documentation. This repository,
as well as this document, provide a description so as to test and deploy the technology
stack.

Deployment and provisioning of instances supported by Ansible and Terraform.

* Tech Stack Layout
The tech stack has the following main services:
- Membership Portal UI & API
- ACM Live
- Minecraft Server
- BreadBot
- Password Manager

Services will be deployed on separate instances of reasonable size for
each one.

We will begin by provisioning instances for each service.
